# MUNCH!

A Tinder-style recipe app using SwiftUI. Users can swipe left or right on random recipes generated from the Spoonacular API. 
When they swipe right, the recipes will be saved in a list so that they can try the recipes later on.

## Purpose

I wanted to make an app involving food and what better way to do it than with a UI inspired by Tinder.

## APIs Used

This project can only be run by acquiring an API key through Spoonacular (for free).
